# 80To20
This is an IOS app that monitors battery status and sends push notifications to the user to let them know what percent their battery is at. 

# Uses
- Be alerted on exact battery charge on chosen time intervals to keep your phone between 20% and 80% (Optimal battery health)

# Limitations
- Apple does not allow developers to run processes in the background so checking the battery status while the app is closed or not in focus is not possible. 
  - Instead the app must be in the foreground to update current battery status and will send Push notifications based on user choice in the settings menu.
